# Sales_Funnel_Analysis_for_Hostel_Chain_Business
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sales funnel for Strent AH Pvt Limited (SAPL), a chain of student hostels in major cities across India. The goal is to understand the different stages of the funnel and identify the significant reasons contributing to the lower lead conversion ratio.

## Problem Statement
SAPL experienced a surge in website visits and app usage during the admission season but had a low conversion rate of approximately 13%. To address this issue, we aimed to dive deep into the various stages of student acquisition and discover the factors causing the substantial drop in conversions.

## Deep Dive into Problem
The Sales & Operations Director identified two key areas of concern: a lower percentage of calls made by the customer care team and a lower percentage of property visits scheduled by leads. This project specifically focuses on the assumption that the low conversion rate is primarily attributed to the lower percentage of calls made by the customer care team.

### Overview
The sales process at SAPL operates through various stages in the sales funnel:

1. **Lead Generation**: SAPL identifies leads from various sources, including organic and paid channels like social media and online advertising. Targeted marketing campaigns are developed to attract potential customers from colleges and coaching classes.

2. **Lead Qualification**: A seamless registration process on the app and website captures lead information and ensures authenticity through mobile number verification. It also gathers essential details about lead requirements and preferences.

3. **Customer Care Interaction**: A dedicated customer care team handles lead follow-ups and categorizes leads into hot, medium, and cold categories. They provide guidance based on lead requirements.

4. **Property Visits**: Property visits are scheduled based on lead preferences. Retail agents provide detailed information about hostel facilities during visits.

5. **Agreement and Onboarding**: Leads initiate an agreement process after confirming interest, which includes document verification, payment collection, and room allocation.
